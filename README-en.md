## Overview
This project is built on mainstream LLM inference technology stacks and the K8s official project GIE (Gateway API Inference Extension), integrating the following K8s-native, high-performance, and scalable sub-features, aiming to improve inference throughput and reduce latency, providing efficient and reliable technical support for AI service deployment.

**Intelligent Routing System (Hermes-router)**: A gateway plugin implemented based on the GIE framework, featuring dynamic request distribution and load balancing capabilities; supports multi-dimensional perception capabilities including diverse compute load awareness, KV hit awareness, request pressure awareness, request length awareness, and semantic awareness. Users can leverage built-in strategy extensions (KVCache aware strategy, PD long/short request bucketing strategy) to achieve optimal node routing for inference requests.

**xPyD Disaggregated Inference Engine**: An AI inference backend built on the high-performance vLLM inference engine, supporting xPyD architecture, inference node auto-discovery (Proxy Server), Mooncake KVCache storage, and flexible multi-instance deployment; the inference engine is deployed via LeaderWorkerSet (LWS), natively supporting multi-DP coordination, and DP load balancing strategies can be configured through `dataParallelSize` and `dataParallelSizeLocal`.

**PD-Orchestrator**: An elastic orchestration component for PD disaggregated scenarios, integrating tidal algorithms, scaling decision frameworks, and dynamic PD group scaling capabilities; supports metric-driven and event-driven resource scaling, group-level and intra-group proportional or custom strategy scaling, and exposes extensibility for user-defined decision and resource management logic.

**Distributed KVCache Management**: Utilizes the Mooncake Hccl Transfer Engine for high-speed KVCache transfer between PD nodes.

**Global KVCache Index (cache-indexer)**: Based on vLLM's KV Event mechanism and providing RESTful interfaces, builds a distributed global KVCache metadata prefix tree, enabling routing KV-aware perception capabilities for efficient utilization of global KVCache resources.

**Inference Observability System (eagle-eye)**: Based on Prometheus standard data collection and reporting formats, provides key observability metrics for inference scenarios, covering business runtime metrics, system runtime metrics, and resource health metrics; through NATS asynchronous message queue publish-subscribe mode, provides real-time (millisecond-level) observability of key business runtime metrics, supporting near-real-time decision capabilities for critical acceleration modules.

## Performance

- **Fixed-length system prompt reuse scenario**: This scenario simulates a workload with fixed-length system prompts where KVCache can be reused. The dataset contains 120 types of 8k-length system prompts, each repeated 4 times, totaling 480 requests. Request times follow a Poisson distribution with concurrency of 8. Using random routing as the performance baseline, after enabling InferNex optimization capabilities, aggregate deployment shows an average TTFT reduction of approximately 54% and an average TPS improvement of approximately 20%, demonstrating significant performance gains.
- **Multi-turn conversation scenario**: This scenario simulates multiple users engaging in continuous conversations with an LLM. A single session contains multiple rounds of requests, with 120 independent users generating 480 requests total. The first round requests 16k tokens, each round returns 128 tokens, and subsequent rounds append 1k tokens for 4 rounds total, averaging approximately 17.5k per request. Request times follow a Poisson distribution with concurrency of 8. Using random routing as the performance baseline, after enabling InferNex optimization capabilities, aggregate deployment shows an average TTFT reduction of approximately 60% and an average TPS improvement of approximately 44%, demonstrating significant performance gains.
- **Inference observability system**: Pod resource consumption CPU <20m, MEM 3000~3500M; second-level reporting publisher average **collection duration <10ms**, subscriber average log **receiving latency <1ms**. For details, see the [eagle-eye Performance Test Report](https://gitcode.com/openFuyao/sig-ai-inference/blob/main/reports/performance/eagle-eye%E6%80%A7%E8%83%BD%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95%E6%8A%A5%E5%91%8A-v26.03.md).

> For detailed performance data and comparative analysis of each optimization strategy, see the [InferNex Performance Test Report](https://gitcode.com/openFuyao/sig-ai-inference/blob/main/reports/performance/InferNex%E6%95%B4%E4%BD%93%E6%80%A7%E8%83%BD%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95%E6%8A%A5%E5%91%8A-v26.06.md).

## Specification Sheet

Each **InferNex major release** publishes the **theoretical supported version ranges** and **verified combinations** for subcomponents. The **core concept** is to use the **InferNex release version as the anchor point**, declaring the support relative to this anchor for inference engines, smart router, pd orchestrators, observability, accelerators, Kubernetes, and other dependencies in the specification sheet; prioritize this table when performing integrated deployments.

> In the table, **Yes** under "Verified" means effective validation has been completed on the corresponding combination; **No** means **not yet verified** (may still work, but not committed as accepted). **All component versions below are theoretical support ranges**, unless otherwise noted in remarks.

- **InferNex-Bridge**: Adaptation layer for integrating InferNex with KServe, supporting dual CRD declarative deployment of InferNex via `LLMInferenceService` / `InferNexService`. See [Component README](component/InferNex-Bridge/README.md).

## Roadmap
 - [26-06] Hermes-router intelligent routing supports perception and scheduling based on instance resource saturation, and secondary scheduling among instances under PD disaggregated architecture.
 - [26-06] InferNex-Deployer improves the continuous integration pipeline, adding production-grade validation for large model PD disaggregated and multi-instance deployment.
 - [26-06] Elastic-scaler focuses on workload distribution acceleration (weights, images, process startup), supporting high-performance elastic scenarios, while complementing event signal-driven scaling and compute-aware strategies.
 - [26-X] Eagle-Eye near-real-time observability will extend dynamic network resource metrics, broaden hardware health and sub-health perception, adapt to A5 generation specifications, and advance error code standardization.
 - [26-X] KVCacheX covers Cache-indexer / conductor and Lingqu enablement-related directions; plans to incorporate iterative enhancements such as DSA and Hybrid Attention KV offloading capabilities.
 - [26-X] Plan KServe integration adaptation for unified management of different types of inference Serving (predictive, LLM, etc.) and compute stack traffic (InferNex, llm-d, etc.); collaborate with the vLLM-ascend community to publish recommended deployment cases based on InferNex.
